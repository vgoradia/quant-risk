## Overview

Enter your stocks and investment amounts, and the dashboard instantly computes volatility, risk-adjusted returns, worst-case scenarios, and diversification metrics across your entire portfolio. Then AI synthesizes all of it into a plain English summary.

## Features

- **Portfolio Safety Score** — a single 0-100 score summarizing overall portfolio risk based on volatility, drawdown, and correlation
- **Price History** — interactive line chart of historical prices across all assets
- **Volatility Analysis** — annualized volatility per stock, color-coded by risk level
- **Sharpe Ratio** — measures return per unit of risk (>1 is good, >2 is great)
- **Max Drawdown** — worst peak-to-trough loss for each asset in the selected period
- **Correlation Heatmap** — shows how stocks move relative to each other to assess diversification
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** — runs 1,000 simulated market scenarios to show best case, expected, and worst case portfolio values over the next year
- **Value at Risk (VaR)** — the maximum you are likely to lose in a single trading day at 95% confidence, the same metric used by major banks and hedge funds
- **Benchmark Comparison** — compare your portfolio returns against SPY, QQQ, or DIA to see if you beat the market
- **Rebalancing Suggestions** — data-driven weight recommendations to reduce risk without sacrificing returns
- **AI Portfolio Summary** — AI reads all your metrics and writes a plain English explanation with actionable suggestions
