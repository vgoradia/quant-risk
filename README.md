## Overview

Most retail investors buy stocks without understanding the risk they're taking on. This tool bridges that gap by giving anyone the ability to analyze their portfolio the same way hedge funds and institutional investors do — for free.

Enter your stocks and investment amounts, and the dashboard instantly computes volatility, risk-adjusted returns, worst-case scenarios, and diversification metrics across your entire portfolio.
